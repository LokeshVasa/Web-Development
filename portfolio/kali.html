    <h1> KALI </h1>
    <p> Kali Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux. It's specifically designed for penetration testing, digital forensics, and other security-related tasks. Kali Linux is widely used by security professionals, ethical hackers, and researchers to test the vulnerabilities of software, networks, and systems.

        History of Kali Linux
        
        Kali Linux was first released in 2013 as "BackTrack" by Pentester's Row, a group of security researchers who wanted to create an operating system that could be used for penetration testing. The name was later changed to Kali Linux in 2014, reportedly because the word "backtrack" implied that you're going back to a previous state, whereas "Kali" is the Hindu goddess of time and change.
        
        Key Features of Kali Linux
